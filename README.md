# Fashion-MNIST-dataset-Tensor-flow

Neural Network example using python with keras API.
Prediction with 89% accuracy.
Output with 100 images prediction.

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. 
We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. 
It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
